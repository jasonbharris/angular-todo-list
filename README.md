# AngularTodoList

Welcome to my Angular Todo List Github Page.

In order to view the project as it is at the moment you are visiting is to:
    
    - Clone the repository
    - Go into the folder in which you loaded cloned it into.
    - Run npm run start or yarn start or just ng serve

- The application has been cleaned up and ready to code
- Create the basic ui
